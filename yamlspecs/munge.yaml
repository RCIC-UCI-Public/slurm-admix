     MUNGE (MUNGE Uid \'N\' Gid Emporium) is an authentication service for creating and 
     validating user credentials. It is designed to be highly scalable for use in an HPC 
     cluster environment. It provides a portable API for encoding the user's identity into a 
     tamper-proof credential that can be obtained by an untrusted client and forwarded by 
     untrusted intermediaries within a security realm. Clients within this realm can create 
     and validate credentials without the use of root privileges, reserved ports, or 
     platform-specific methods.
